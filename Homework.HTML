                    <h2> Facts About Cats</h2>
                    <p>
                        Meowing is an interesting vocalization produced by adult cats. 
                        It is a way of communicating with people. Interestingly cats do not meow 
                        to other cats or other animals, just at people. Kittens on the other hand 
                        meow to communicate to their mothers but once they grow big, they no longer meow to other cats. 
                        Cats meow to greet people, solicit attention, to ask for food, ask to be let in or out.
                         Adult cats speak to each other through scent, facial expression, and complex body languages. 
                         Cats use different types of meows depending on the situation.
                         A pleasant meow sound is used to solicit food 
                         while a loud unpleasant meow is used to express annoyance.

                        Cats can climb up a tree with ease but coming down the same way is a challenge to them.
                         A cat would rather jump from a tree than climb down with its head first down.
                          To get down, a cat must back down or jump.
                           Catsâ€™ claws are curved backward and that facilitates climbing up a tree or wall. 
                           They simply hook their claws in the cracks and push themselves upward. 
                           When coming down head first the claws curve upwards and cannot 
                           hold them securely on a tree or climbing surface.
                         Cats that do not know what to do while up a tree will remain there
                          until help comes their way.
